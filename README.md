# Reacher
This is the second project of the deep reinforcement learning nano-degree made by udacity.
* Environment: rectangular space with 20 double-jointed arms that can move without collision.
* Agent and its actions: 20 double-jointed arms that can move to target locations. Each arm action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.
* State space: The observation space for each arm consists of 33 variables corresponding to its position, rotation, velocity, and its angular velocities.
* Reward Function:  A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.
* Task: The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.

## Step 1: Dependencies

To set up your python environment to run the code in this repository, follow the instructions below.

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	source activate drlnd
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6 
	activate drlnd
	```
	
2. Follow the instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/openai/gym) to perform a minimal install of OpenAI gym.  
	- Next, install the **classic control** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#classic-control).
	- Then, install the **box2d** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#box2d).
	
3. Clone the deep-reinforcement-learning repository, and navigate to the `python/` folder.  Then, install several dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning.git
cd deep-reinforcement-learning/python
pip install .
```

4. Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `drlnd` environment.  
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name "drlnd"
```

5. Before running code in a notebook, change the kernel to match the `drlnd` environment by using the drop-down `Kernel` menu. 

## Step 2: Download the Unity Environment

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 1) or [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 2) to obtain the "headless" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent.  (_To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above._)

2. Place the file in the `Reacher` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file.

## Step 3: Run all the cells of Navigation.ipynb
Running all the cells will train the agent, save a checkpoint after reaching 30 score and finally test the agent from the checkpoint on 100 steps. If you want to use the already existing checkpoint you can skip the training cell. Preferably, train the model on a GPU supporting environment as it takes less time.
